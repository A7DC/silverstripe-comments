# TODO
	
The module is still very much in development. I have published it simply as a proof of concept
of the new API. Feel free to recommend changes.

## Things to do.

 * Merge Simon Welsh's jQuery work for page comments back in.
 * Check comment moderation 
 * Rework CommentAdmin to ensure it still works
 * Test enabling comments on more than 1 instance per page
 * Test enabling comments on a dataobject
 * Migration Scripts
 * Testing
 * Documentation
